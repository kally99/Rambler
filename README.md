# Rambler

Malaria infections often contain multiple haplotypes. When sequenced at several points in time, these haplotypes may be present for a period beforing cleaing as parasite density decreases. We may also fail to detect a haplotype at a given point in time due to imperfect sensitivity of our sequencing. Rambler takes these factors into account and produces estimates of the time(s) at which each individual in a longitudinal cohort became infected, and for how long this infection lasted.
