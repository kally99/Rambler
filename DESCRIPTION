Description: Malaria infections often contain multiple haplotypes. When 
    sequenced at several points in time, these haplotypes may be present for a 
    period beforing cleaing as parasite density decreases. We may also fail to 
    detect a haplotype at a given point in time due to imperfect sensitivity of
    our sequencing. Rambler takes these factors into account and produces 
    estimates of the time(s) at which each individual in a longitudinal cohort 
    became infected, and for how long this infection lasted.
