Description: Malaria infections often contain multiple genotypes. When
    sequenced together, these produce a complex signal that is a mixture of the
    individual genotypes. Like earlier programs like DEploid, Tapestry
    attempts to pull these individual genotypes apart by exploiting allele
    frequency imbalances within a sample. The difference in Tapestry is that we
    assume a model of allele frequencies rather than a reference panel. We also
    implement parallel tempered MCMC to ensure good mixing, and produce a
    different set of outputs.
